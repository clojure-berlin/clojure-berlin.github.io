# Clojure Berlin website

This is the repo for https://clojure.berlin/ which we plan to use to track new meetups. This will be increasingly useful if we were to move from meetup.com to a new home - competitors such as https://lu.ma/ do not seem to have group pages, per se.

# Contributing

## Using devenv with direnv
1. install nix
2. `cp .envrc.example .envrc`
3. `direnv allow .`

You should now have all depenencies installed when you cd here.

## Develop
To develop, `devenv up` should start zola's auto-reloading server.
