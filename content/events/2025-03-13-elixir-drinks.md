# Pre Bobkonf get together with Elixir Berlin

Join us for friendly beers at Volksbar in Mitte on Thursday! We're organizing this event together with our fellow Functional Programming aficionados from [Elixir Berlin](https://elixir.berlin).

But wait, there's more: this event also doubles as pre-conference drinks for [Bobkonf 2025](https://bobkonf.de/2025/en/), which is happening this weekend.

If you don't have a ticket yet, use discount code CLOJURE-ELIXIR-MEETUP-BONUS for 12.5% off.
