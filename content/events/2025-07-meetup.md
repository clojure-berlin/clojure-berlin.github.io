# Clojure Meetup - July 2025

Join us for our summer Clojure meetup in Berlin!

We are going to have a short intro on [clojure-mcp](https://github.com/bhauman/clojure-mcp) and how you can use it with existing tools. Afterwards, we are going to split into groups and do a Learning Dojo to experiment with it.

Please RSVP on Luma to stay updated.
